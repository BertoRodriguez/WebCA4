            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I love games. Recently I've been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)">Hades</a> which is
                a indie roguelike action dungeon crawler developed and published 
                by Supergiant games which has won and been nomiated for countless awards.
                I also enjoy anime and visual novels, 
                my favourite of which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anohana">Anohana</a> 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clannad_(video_game)#">Clannad</a> respectively.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Born in Slough, a pretty uninteresting town in England
                (fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series)">The Office</a> was filmed there).
                I soon moved to Scotland where I have lived for 16 years. I don't remember 
                much from my younger years apart from that I used to love 
                using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> (the programming language) 
                I'm not sure if that's what kindled my love for coding but it <b>would</b> make sense.

            <h2>Current Life</h2>
            <p>Right now I am a Computing Science student at Aberdeen university in my second year.
                I work part time at McDonalds. Recently I've been working on Assignments for classes but
                I hope that when I have some spare time I can have a go at creating an app. 
                I am also looking for apprenticeships for work related to computing science.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                First I created a list of things which needed to be included: home page 
                containing introduction, about page talking about current studies etc.
                I then layed out some basic semantics for the structure of the webpage, 
                e.g. the nav bar, sections, footer etc. I then added some text to check if the layout was
                suitable and made changes where needed. I then chose a colour scheme and styled my webpages accordingly.
