            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Born in Slough, a pretty uninteresting town in England
                (fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series)">The Office</a> was filmed there).
                I soon moved to Scotland where I have lived for 16 years. I don't remember 
                much from my younger years apart from that I used to love 
                using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> (the programming language) 
                I'm not sure if that's what kindled my love for coding but it <b>would</b> make sense.
            </p>

            <h2>Current Life</h2>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
